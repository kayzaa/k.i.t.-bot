  "body": "## Vision Gap\n\nVISION mentions passive income generation through yield farming - not implemented.\n\n## Required Features\n\n### Yield Discovery\n- Fetch top yields from DefiLlama API\n- Filter by TVL, APY, risk level\n- Protocol reputation scoring\n\n### Strategy Selection\n- Conservative: Blue-chip stablecoins only\n- Balanced: Mix of stable and volatile\n- Aggressive: High APY with higher risk\n\n### Automation\n- Auto-enter promising farms\n- Auto-exit declining farms\n- Harvest and compound rewards\n- Gas cost optimization\n- IL protection thresholds\n\n### Risk Management\n- Maximum allocation per farm\n- Protocol exposure limits\n- Smart contract risk assessment\n- Rug-pull detection\n\n## Example Flow\n1. K.I.T. discovers 15% APY on Curve stETH/ETH\n2. Risk check: Lido + Curve = trusted protocols\n3. Allocate $5000 (within limits)\n4. Monitor daily, compound weekly\n5. Alert if APY drops below 10%\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Discovers real yield opportunities\n- [ ] Executes farming strategies\n- [ ] Compounds rewards automatically\n- [ ] Manages risk exposure\n\n## Priority: HIGH",
