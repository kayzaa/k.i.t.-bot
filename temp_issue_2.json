  "body": "## Vision Gap\n\nThe VISION.md describes **Three Levels of Autonomy** - NONE are currently implemented.\n\n## Required Implementation\n\n### Level 1: Assistant Mode\n- K.I.T. analyzes markets and suggests trades\n- Human must approve every action\n- Full transparency and control\n- Good for learning and building trust\n\n### Level 2: Co-Pilot Mode\n- Small actions: autonomous (e.g., trades under $100)\n- Large actions: ask for approval\n- Configurable thresholds\n- Daily summary reports\n\n### Level 3: Full Autopilot\n- K.I.T. handles everything autonomously\n- Human gets daily/weekly reports\n- Emergency alerts only\n- THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL\n\n## Technical Design\n\n```typescript\ninterface AutonomyConfig {\n  level: 1 | 2 | 3;\n  thresholds?: {\n    maxTradeSize: number;\n    maxDailyLoss: number;\n    maxPositions: number;\n  };\n  notifications: 'all' | 'important' | 'emergency';\n  reportFrequency: 'realtime' | 'daily' | 'weekly';\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] User can select autonomy level\n- [ ] Level 1: All actions require approval\n- [ ] Level 2: Threshold-based auto-approval\n- [ ] Level 3: Full autonomous operation\n- [ ] Seamless transition between levels\n\n## Priority: CRITICAL",
