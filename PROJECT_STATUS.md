## 🆕 Latest Improvements (19:33 Session)

### ✅ Webhook Endpoints Added (OpenClaw-inspired)

Added HTTP webhook endpoints for external system integration:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/hooks/wake` | POST | Enqueue a system event, optionally trigger immediate heartbeat |
| `/hooks/agent` | POST | Run an isolated agent turn (async, returns 202) |
| `/hooks/trade` | POST | K.I.T.-specific: Trigger trade signals via HTTP |

**Features:**
- Token authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `x-kit-token` header
- Request body size limit (1MB)
- Proper error handling with JSON responses
- Integration with internal hooks system

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Wake event
curl -X POST http://localhost:18789/hooks/wake \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"New trading opportunity","mode":"now"}'

# Trade signal
curl -X POST http://localhost:18789/hooks/trade \
  -H 'x-kit-token: YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"symbol":"BTC/USDT","action":"buy","amount":0.1}'
```
